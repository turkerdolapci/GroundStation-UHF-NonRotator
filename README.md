# UHF-Ground-Station
This repo contains a non-rotator UHF ground station setup to receive LEO satellite signals.

## Scope
The final products will be presented along with the analysis steps, to the utmost.
Shared work (and used tools) will include but will not be limited with:
- Block diagrams (draw.io),
- System analyses (GNU Octave),
- RF front-ends (QucsStudio),
- Antennas (4Nec2),
- Circuit schematics and layouts (KiCad).
  
Objective of this work is not only sharing the information but also to experience maintaining a repo. It's my first repo, YAY!
